Enchantment requires a lot of effort. Repeat what I do if you want to be good at it!<br>
First! Shout my name three times!<br>
Second! Circle Ancient City Arcan three times!<br>
Lastly! Go to a quiet place, and imagine yourself holding the enchanted weapons or armor! Right!<br>
You can't skip any of the steps!<br>
