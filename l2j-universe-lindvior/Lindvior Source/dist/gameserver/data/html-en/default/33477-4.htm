Hmm, it sounds like you are asking about Sayune. When the war between the gods and Giants began the Giants needed a way
to move swiftly. Sayune, the daughter of Sayha and a Giant, infused her powers into the ground in places. This allowed
others to jump to different locations in the same manner she did.<br>
Of course one would only be able to do this if they became Awakened, otherwise you would never be able to see it… and if
you could, you would never be able to use it.
