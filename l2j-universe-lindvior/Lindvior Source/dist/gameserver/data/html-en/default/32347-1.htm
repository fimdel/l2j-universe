Shadai:

The Ancient Text ot the Demon is an old tome regarded as an unholy scriptures by the Demons of Hellbound. It was created through the power of darkness and contains a mysterious energy, which can be very useful -- if you can obtain it, of course.

You can find the Hidded First Page, the Hidden Second Page and the Fragment of a Contact with the Demon by reading this book. However, it will turn to dust if you try to use phisical strength on it, so you must be careful.

If you bring it to me, I can put it to good use -- it will be utterly useless to you, in case you had other ideas. But give it to me and I will exchange it for item of greather value for you.
