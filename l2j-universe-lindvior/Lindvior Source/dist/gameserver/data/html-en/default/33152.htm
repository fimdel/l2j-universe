<body>Thai:<br>This is where Istina gives birth to a new life... or more like creepy new experiments. <br>Some of those
experiments are useful though. Right now, we're looking at <font color="LEVEL">Tissue Energy Residue</font>. Tissue
Energy seems to possess the creation powers of Istina. Preliminary tests show that it might enable us to cure disease
and bring dead tissues back to life, but we need more samples to be sure. <br>Tissue Energy Residue can be collected
from Failed Creation, or <font color="LEVEL">Energy Regeneration</font> can be converted to Tissue Energy Residue.<br>Would
you collect Energy Regeneration and bring it here, before it disappears, so we can convert it to Tissue Energy Residue?
