<body>Mentor Guide:<br>
If you allow me to break the fourth wall for a moment, new or returning players who have not played Lineage II in awhile
might find some aspects of the game have changed or are a bit challenging.<br>
The Mentor/Mentee system was designed to help anyone who is in that situation.<br>
A more experienced player will fill the role as the Mentor, while the new or inexperienced player will be the
Mentee.<br>
