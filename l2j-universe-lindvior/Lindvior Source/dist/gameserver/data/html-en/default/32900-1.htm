<body>Mumu:<br>Well, there's a warehouse and shops - just enter the village and turn left! Otherwise, if you turn right,
you'll see people from the Elf village.<br>The tall building here is the Arcan tower, where our brave hero, Slaski,
resides!<br>Lastly, the thing in the center of the village is the axis of this place, but recently there have been
strange people appearing there, and now we can't approach because of the dark energy...
