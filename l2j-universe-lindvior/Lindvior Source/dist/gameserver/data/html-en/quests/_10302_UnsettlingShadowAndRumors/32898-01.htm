Well, you know, do not tell me the details ... Perhaps it's because I come not from these places. <br>
By the way, you do not plan to stay here for awhile? You are here recently, so the locals have no reason not to love

And I just have to please you! Could you ask the locals about these parts, and then tell me? <br>
