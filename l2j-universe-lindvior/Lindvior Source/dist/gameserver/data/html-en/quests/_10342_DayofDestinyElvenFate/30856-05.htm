You`re probably aware of the Seal of Shilen region located in the outskirts of Aden Castle. However, you might not be
aware that Shilen`s minions are now preparing to attack this Aden Castle.<br>
We found where the minions were gathering, and,hoping to catch them unawares, sent a party to attack them before they
had left. As you probably guessed... we haven`t heard anything from them. We need someone... you... to find them.<br>
