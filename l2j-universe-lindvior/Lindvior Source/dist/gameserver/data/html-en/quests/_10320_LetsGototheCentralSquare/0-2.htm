Pantheon
It is a devastating tale that you will soon learn.
Once one of the seals that bound the Goddess of Destruction
was released, many catastrophic events followed. Such was
the case with the fall of Ye Sagira. Scholars including
myself were dispatched to study the ruins. Soon all other
races came as well. I cannot recall the event fully, but
Theodore knows more about when the migration of all the
races came to Talking Island Village. You should speak
with him.<!--
