!Soldier Orbyu:

Really? Thank you.

If you hunt *Rok* and open its stomach, you will find undigested remains. The same is true of the *Mutant Birds and Dra Hawks*, although you'll find fewer remains in them.

Bring me *Swallowed Skulls* as evidence, as well as *Swallowed Sternums* and *Swallowed Bones*. We will reward you for your efforts -- especially for the skulls you bring back.

One more thing: Rok fears the Dark Black Dragon's followers. That's why it emerges only when the Seed of Infinity is *stabilized*. That means *Rok can only be hunted when the Seed is occupied*. Remember that!

Good luck and good hunting.
