!Soldier Orbyu:

The bigger problem is *Rok*, who became undead because of the evil power of the Seed of Infinity. The Rok and its followers, *Mutant Birds and Dra Hawks* are viciously attacking everyone in their sight.

They have attacked and eaten people before, but not like this.

The army has been ordered to destroy them. I'm in charge of recruiting the adventurers we need for the task.

I guess it's better this way. Only by destroying their accursed lives can we truly liberate these once-noble creatures.

Will you help us?
