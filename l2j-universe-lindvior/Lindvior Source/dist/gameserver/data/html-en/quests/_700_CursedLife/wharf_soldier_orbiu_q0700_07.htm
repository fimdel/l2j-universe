!Soldier Orbyu:

How was your hunting? Let me see the remains I asked you to bring back.

Hmm... I'd hoped for more. Perhaps you haven't yet found the *Rok*.

But since you brought the remains from some of the lesser birds, I will give you the reward I promised.

You're going back out, aren't you?
