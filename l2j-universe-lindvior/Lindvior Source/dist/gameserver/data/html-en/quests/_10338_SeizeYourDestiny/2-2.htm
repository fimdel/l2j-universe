<body>Hermuncus:<br>
Thank you for listening to my plea for help. You have saved me from a most terrible fate! Because of you I am free from
the bindings that the gods placed upon me.<br>
I am the Last Giant Hermuncus. I am the true and rightful master to all races of this world. As I promised, I will show
you the way to become Awakened and learn how to use the Giant’s power. Here is the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of
    Afterlife</font>. The power of the Giants has been passed down from generation to generation embedding their power
within this tome.<br>
Before accepting this power I must warn you that you will have to give up all that you have learned. Also, you can be
consumed by this power if you do not know how to control it. Although, by looking at you I can tell that despite these
warnings you still wish to accept the power of the Giants.<br>
