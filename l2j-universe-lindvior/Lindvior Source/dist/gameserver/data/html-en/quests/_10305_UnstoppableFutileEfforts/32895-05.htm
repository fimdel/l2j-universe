<body>Elder Hierarch Fairy Noeti Mimilead:<br>
Destroy <font color="LEVEL"> Cocoons </ font> and <font color="LEVEL"> Huge Cocoons </ font> in the Colonies Fay. Of
course, the destruction of cocoons will not give us much - the fairies no longer be the same again, and the trees will
be new cocoons. <br>
But we can not sit idly by. We will work tirelessly with the cocoons, and sooner or later, our troubles will pass.
