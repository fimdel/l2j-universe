<body>Magmeld Emissary Leader Lada:<br>
Nice that you agreed! Then immediately go to the entrance to the cave for <font color="LEVEL">Angelic Falls</font><font
        color="LEVEL">and find Great Green Forest, which is like Bog Spirits </ font>. Try using this one <font
        color="LEVEL">Shimmering Crystal</font>. They are made of mica mined in Magmelde. So, in Aden can not get
anything like that. <br>
If you use sparkling crystals around will gather <font color="LEVEL">Swamp Spirits</font>. <br>
Catch the Swamp Ghost, and bring it to Slack in the Ancient City of Arkan. Then the elder will be gracious to you. <br>
Cats are very suspicious, so you do not succeed to find out if you come empty-handed.
