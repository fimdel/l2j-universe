Welcome to the Beast Farm! Anyone can raise a beast in this place. If you are lucky, that beast will then tamely follow
you. If you are not so lucky, well...you better hope you can defeat the creature!<br>
Anyway, I sell feed for beasts here: <font color="LEVEL">Golden Spice</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Crystal
    Spice</font>.<br>
Golden Spice helps beasts grow larger, while Crystal Spice helps bones and skins become tougher. If you want a beast to
become rich, feed it Golden Spice. If you want to raise it strong, feed it Crystal Spice.<br>
Why not buy both and compare their effects?<br>
