<body>Shadai:<br>
Greetings, traveler! I am Shadai of Hellbound, the legendary Dwarven blacksmith. Ah, I know I may look a bit shabby, but
you mustn't judge a sword by its
sheath! Ha ha ha! You are a lucky fellow, my friend, to have bumped into me. Interested in turning that luck into
wealth? I'll make you a deal:
if you get me an item I need, I'll use my skills to craft you something.<br>
