<body>Officer Carrier Chandra:<br>
Alright! I can easily manage 200 boxes an hour! How about 300? Nothing gets the blood pumping like the prospect of
breaking your own record!<br>
Huh? Were you there all along? Well, you've got a front row seat, my friend. I'm the new <font
        color="LEVEL">Carrier</font> here. Our volume has really picked up, so the guild decided to expand the
operation. You don't know what a Carrier does? In the simplest terms, it's a person who sends freight here and there. Of
course, in reality it's not nearly as simple as it sounds!<br>
And there are complications. Sometimes other things get mixed in, things like <font color="LEVEL">rats</font>...<br>

<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 1">Ask where the freight is.</a><br>
