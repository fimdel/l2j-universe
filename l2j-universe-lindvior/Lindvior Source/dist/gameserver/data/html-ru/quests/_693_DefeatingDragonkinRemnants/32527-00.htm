<body>Officer Edric:<br>
When I was a soldier, I fought, armed only with patriotism and loyalty. And I survived, as you can see. But all I got
for my efforts were these menial chores and this lowly rank of "Officer."<br>
Ha! How I long for the days when I saw my enemy face to face! But I am still a soldier, and I will still obey orders --
no matter how much I hate them.<br>
So I kill only time now watching the courageous <font color="LEVEL">adventurers match their skills against the remnants
    of the Dragon Tribe</font>. When you have a little more experience, perhaps you can take part.<br>
(Only characters who are level 75 or above may undertake this quest.)<br>
