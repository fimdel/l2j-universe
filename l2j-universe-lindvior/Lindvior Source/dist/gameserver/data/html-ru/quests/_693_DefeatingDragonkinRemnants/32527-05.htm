<body>Officer Edric:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">You're now registered for battle.</font><br>
I'm looking forward to seeing what you can do in there... <br>
What? Don't look at me like that. Do you think the higher-level officers care about mere remnants? Nobody cares about
them! Do with them whatever you want. <font color="LEVEL">Your name will be remembered as a hero who attacked the
    Mounted Troop, defeated them and killed many of the Dragon Tribe!</font> Ha ha!<br>
Now see to your party's preparations. When you're ready, have your party leader let me know.<br>
