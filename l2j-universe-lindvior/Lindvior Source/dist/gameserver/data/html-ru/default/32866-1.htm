<body>Separated Soul:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Will of Antharas</font> is a command stone that
Antharas embedded into his high commanding
minions. With this stone Antharas has the ability
to control these creatures to do his bidding. It is
a required ingredient for creating an Antharas
Blood Crystal.<br>
A long time ago when Antharas' blood was split
on the ground the poison in the blood corrupted
the land. However, over time land acted as a
filter separating the poison from the blood. The
result was a pure form of Antharas blood that
crystallized over time into small <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Blood
    Crystals</font>. The power in Antharas' blood has a
high concentration of regenaration and
restoration power. Enough that it even has the
power to bring back the dead. It is a required
ingredient for creating an Antharas Blood Crystal.<br>
