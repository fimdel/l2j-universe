It was a fantastic place. Orbs of light emanating warmth float in the air, and there were creatures that I've never seen
in Aden.<br>
Oh, I didn't go close to them, of course. I would've gotten into big trouble with Lada if I had acted recklessly and got
hurt in the process.<br>
If you want to visit there yourself, talk to Magmeld Delegation Leader Lada in the Hunters Village. He'll tell you what
to do.<br>
