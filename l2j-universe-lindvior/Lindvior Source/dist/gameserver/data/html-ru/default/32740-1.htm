There's something about this place, an unescapable feeling of peace. I used to know that feeling very well here.
Unfortunately, the truth behind my people's past keeps me from enjoying that feeling anymore. You see, the Plains have
been showered with the blood of my people. In the wake of Antharas' death, we struggled for this land, bloodlust fueling
brother against brother, father against son.<br>It was the Seer who united the new tribe of Tanta to defeat the Leto. He
is known amongst my people as a great leader, but he also kills any who oppose him.<br>
I can't just sit back and watch anymore. But I won't send someone to be slaughtered either. I must know you can handle
Ugoros in battle!<br>
