How do you feel? You should give yourself a minute to adjust.<br>
You now have 2 special skills. If you use Treykan Claw, Torumba won't care if you are man or beast. The jig will be up
and you'll have to fight for your life.<br>
If things get out of control, use your Treykan Dash skill to increase your speed.<br>
I'll let you figure out the rest. May your god smile upon you.
