I have no information about the origins of this species, but what I have found is that these creatures do possess a
unique energy, sort of plasma if you will. Hmm… <font color="LEVEL">Maguen Plasma</font>. I like that. I think that is
what I’ll call it. Anyway, when a Maguen appears it begins to bring forth one of these plasmas. It will also cycle
through its various plasmas before hiding.<br>
With Blacksmith Kusto’s talent and my magic we were able to create a device that could harvest these plasmas… a <font
        color="LEVEL">Maguen Plasma Collector</font>. I know it isn’t too creative but we decided to keep the name
simple to avoid explaining what it does. <br>
Ugh… fine. I’ll explain it to you. When you are in the Seed and a Maguen appears you have a very limited time to collect
the Maguen Plasma. If you don’t collect the plasma in time the Maguen will go back into hiding. I’ve set up a practice
Maguen if you want to try using the Maguen Plasma Collector.<br>
This isn’t a real Maguen, so you won’t collect any Plasma… just thought you should know so you don’t get your hopes
up.<br>
