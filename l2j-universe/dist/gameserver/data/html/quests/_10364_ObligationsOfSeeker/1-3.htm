Walter:
<br>
That's the problem, I don't know what 
happened! We've been working together 
just fine,  then suddenly he gets all 
bent out of shape and storms off. I tried 
to find out what the problem was, and 
smooth things over, but he wouldn't even 
talk to me.<br>I don't know what he's all 
worked up about, and frankly, I don't care! 
Stubborn old... Grr!
<br>
Well, I have some work related papers that 
I want to give to him, but I don't want to 
make waves. Could you take them to him for me?
