Well... good!
<br>
So you must see how jarring it is when two 
commandos in the same unit don't see eye to 
eye! Sadly, I'm not just spouting hypotheticals 
here - there are two soldiers in my unit 
who won't talk to each other. If they were to 
go into combat, they'd be one hell of a weak link...
<br>
I want someone to get them talking again. 
Negotiate, bang their heads together... 
I don't care.
