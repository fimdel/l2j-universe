<html><head><body>Guard Schunain:<br>Really? I thought everyone knew about Sakum. Well, since you seem to have been living in a cave... He escaped the labyrinth on Talking Island and has been on some sort of rampage.<br>I saw <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font> from a distance, just a few days ago, but I was the only guard on duty and couldn't leave my post. Maybe it dropped these marks, and the spiders ate them, and that's why they're so much more aggressive lately.<br>Well, unless there's anything else, I would like to get back to my nap... uh, I mean, back to my guard duties.</body></html>
