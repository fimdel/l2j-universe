My master, <font color="LEVEL">Hermuncus</font>, is the last Giant. In the distant past, there was a war between the
gods and the Giants. My master fought against the light and managed to steal the power from the gods! But, in the end,
the Giants were defeated. All but my master were exterminated, and my master was facing his final days...<br>
Even the goods found it too difficult to kill a Giant as huge and powerful as my master. For his crimes, his soul was
torn from his body and imprisoned in Ye Sagira. His shell of a corpse was ripped apart and scattered across the land. He
was to be an example of what would happen if anyone challenged the gods ever again.<br>
When Shilen tore Ye Sagira from the sky causing it to crash it broke part of the seal that contained Hermuncus soul,
allowing him to find those who would be able help him. You need to find Hermuncus and break the remaining seals to free
his soul.<br>
