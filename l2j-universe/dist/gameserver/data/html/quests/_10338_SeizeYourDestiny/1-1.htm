<body>Hadel:<br>
There is something… strange about you. I am Hadel, a disciple of the great Giant Hermuncus. What brings you to this
place? Are you another one of those tomb raiders looking to steal artifacts from the Giants? Speak!<br>
Oh, Cellphine sent you here… then that is what I sense about you. You are here to free my master Hermuncus. I can feel
strong and unyielding energy resonating within your soul. Yes, you do seem to have certain strength about you suitable
to save the master.<br>
