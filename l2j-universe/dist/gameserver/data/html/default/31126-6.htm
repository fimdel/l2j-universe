<html><body>Blacksmith of Mammon:<br>
Do you know about the Foundation Items? Even we blacksmiths see them only infrequently.<br>
These uncommon items are brought into being by a power than goes beyond mere chance. We Dwarves say that it is the blessing of Maphr.<br>
That perfect craftsmanship is beyond the Human race's capacity. <br>It is not, however, beyond mine. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">Mammon's Varnish Enhancer, which is sold by the Merchant of Mammon</font>. Then I will use techniques known only to me to transform the item into something accessible to mortals.<br>Be sure to select a helmet among the rare items that provides you with a useful power. Don't worry if you make the wrong choice, though. You will have another chance to make a selection.<br>
