Subclass/Dual Class Master Raina:<br>

Sorry, but you're not qualified to add a subclass.<br1>
To add a new subclass, you need the following qualifications:<br><br>

First,<font color="LEVEL"> you've completed the 'Red Thread of Fate' quest.</font> 
If you want to get on that, let me know.<br>

Second, <font color="LEVEL">your current class has done 
the 2nd class transfer, and all your 
subclass levels are 75 or higher.</font> For 
example, if your subclasses are Temple 
Knight and Silver Ranger, they must 
both be level 75 for you to add a third 
subclass.<br>

Third, you may only have <font color="LEVEL"> up to 3 
subclasses</font>, I'm Affraid.<br><br>

Got it?
