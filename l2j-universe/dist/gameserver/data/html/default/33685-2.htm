Mysterious Butler:<br>

This title has been granted with my 
master's authority to the clan that 
produced this week's winner, the 
greatest warrior.<br1>
This title is given to just <font color="LEVEL">one clan</font> 
among all the clans.<br>
It is given at the beginning of a new 
week to the clan that is associated 
with the greatest warrior. The title 
doesn't transfer, even if that warrior 
switches to another clan.<br>
It grants a special buff that gives a 
little bit of help to nearby clan 
members who belong to the greatest 
clan.<br>
