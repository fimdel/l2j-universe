Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>

Subclass skill certification and learning 
actually require tons of effort. Not just 
effort - it's more fundamental than 
that. The enormous pressure it puts 
on your soul... a normal person 
wouldn't be able to survive it.<br>

Not that it's completely impossible if 
you use special herbs. Except that 
those herbs cost about <font color="LEVEL"><?COST?> million 
Adena</font> each. But i have the herbs 
handy, so as long as you pay up, I can 
cancel that certification for you.<br>

If you cancel the certification, <font color="LEVEL"> your 
current certification status disappears, 
and all certificates and sealbooks 
you didn't learn skills will be 
deleted.</font> So... what do you want to do?
