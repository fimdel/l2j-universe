May Mammon bless you! I the 
Blacksmith of Mammon, have come to 
offer you arms of the highest quality.<br>
I shall mend your weapons and armor 
with skills that no novice blacksmith 
could ever hope to imitate.<br>
Yet there are a few things I must tell 
you. Although we dwarves of Mammon 
didn't deal in coins of the outside world 
before, we have changed with the 
times and now accept them. Also 
remember that you can only remove 
seals from A-grade items with village 
blacksmiths now. Lastly, I can change 
the status of Bound items for you, if 
you provide an Unbinding Scroll for me.<br>
