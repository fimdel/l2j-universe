Mysterious Butler:<br>

I heard many have been curious about 
the Mysterious Mansion since it 
appeared. This is also your reason for 
talking to me, I assume?<br>
I cannot tell you everything, but I will 
give you one piece of information. Did 
you know that the Ceremony of Chaos 
is being sponsored by the Mysterious 
Mansion?<br>
My master enjoys meeting great 
warriors, and sometimes gives gifts to 
those he likes. But not everyone gets 
to meet him - only those who prove 
themselves worthy can meet my 
master.<br>
This is where warriors come to prove 
their worth and their clans' honor, 
hoping to meet my master one day. 
Also, my master will bestow his 
authority upon the clan that fosters 
the greatest warrior.<br>
Oh, and you know that you need both 
luck and strength to be the best, 
right? Well, you'll see for yourself soon 
enough, I suppose.<br>
I Hope to greet you as an honored 
guest here.<br>
