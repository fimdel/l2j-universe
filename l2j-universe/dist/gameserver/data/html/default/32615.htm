Maestro Ishuma:

The Merchants of Mammon are mistaken. We must adjust to the world, not the other way around. A good blacksmith finds the tool or weapon that already exists within the steel; he doesn't seek to impose his will on it.

The boats to and from Gracia? Not many in the Black Anvil Guild can work with the items coming from Gracia. Even if they could, most don't have time to learn. But it's a different story for the Merchants of Mammon.

Fortunately, I have the skills and the time. What can I do for you?
