<body>Cellphine:<br>Do you know of the ancient <font color="LEVEL">war</font> between the <font color="LEVEL">gods and
    Giants</font>? Sadly, the Giants lost that war and were hunted into extinction. However, they were the owners of
this world. At least they were better caretakers of the world than the Gods! They didn’t care about their creations!
Only about their own petty quarrels. When they ruled the races it was utter chaos and terror. When the Giants ruled,
everyone was happy.<br>
