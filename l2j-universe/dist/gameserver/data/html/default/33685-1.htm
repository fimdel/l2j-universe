Mysterious Butler:<br>

Invitations will go out every day from 
20:00 to 24:00 at 15-minute intervals. 
You can request to participate in the 
Ceremony of Chaos through this 
invitation.<br>
Ony the chosen will stand on the 
battleground for the greatest of 
warriors.<br>
Up to 18 warriors can battle in one 
location. If you are lucky, you will be 
the only one left standing and become 
the winner. If you're lucky, that is.<br>
Anyway, the battle ends when there is 
only one left standing. We will take 
steps to ensure that you are unaware 
of each other's identities. If there are 
multiple challengers remaining after 5 
minutes, the one with the highest 
number of kills will be the winner. 
Remember, everyone is an enemy 
here!<br>
When the winner is determined, 1 - 5 
mysterious boxes will apprear at 
random. You can receive the rewards 
of victory through these boxes, as well 
as Mysterious Marks. Bring them to me 
and I will exchange them for reward 
items.<br>
Each cycle lasts a month, and for each 
cycle, the one with the most 
Mysterious Marks will earn the title of 
the greatest warrior. If the highest 
number of Mysterious Marks is equal, 
there will be no winner for that cycle.<br>
Also, the clan that fostered the 
greatest warrior shall earn the title of 
the greatest clan. You can exchange 
your Mysterious Marks for reward 
items without affecting the total 
score.<br>
