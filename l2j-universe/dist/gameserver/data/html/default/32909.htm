Did you feel that? That shaking? There it is again! And that horrible smell... Ugh! It's coming from the Ancient City Arcan. That miasma, it makes its way through fissures deep under the city, mixes with the rot of the city and becomes dark energy.<br>
We witches, we happy few, we band of dancing witches, we're working hard to block the dark energy.<br>
